          <h3>International Women's Day (IWD)</h3>
          <p>
            International Women's Day (IWD) is celebrated annually on March 8th.
            It is a day to celebrate the social, economic, cultural, and
            political achievements of women and to call for gender equality. The
            theme for International Women's Day changes annually, but the
            overall goal of the day remains the same: to celebrate women's
            achievements and raise awareness about the challenges women still
            face in achieving equality. International Women's Day has been
            observed since the early 1900s and was officially recognized by the
            United Nations in 1975. Today, IWD is celebrated in countries around
            the world with events, rallies, and demonstrations calling for
            gender equality and women's rights. IWD is a reminder that although
            progress has been made in the fight for women's rights, there is
            still much work to be done. On this day, people come together to
            celebrate the achievements of women and to work towards a more equal
            and just world for all.
